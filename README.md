ECS 165A Milestone #1

by: Austin Lew, Keon Sadeghi, Wanzhu Zheng, Aryan Punjani, Alex Amiri

Our goal as a group is to design a database system based on a simplified L-Store from scratch alongside a hybrid transactional analytical processing database. This project is split into three parts, each one being focused on a specific milestone that we are attempting to reach as a group to steadily build and complete our database systems. We aim to take risks with this project in order to test the boundaries to see how complex and fast we can make this databse run.
